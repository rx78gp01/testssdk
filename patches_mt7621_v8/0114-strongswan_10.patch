+    pf-handler: Fix build with musl C library
+    
+    musl's headers define a lot of networking structs.  For some, the
+    definition in the Linux UAPI headers is then suppressed by e.g.
+    __UAPI_DEF_ETHHDR.
+    
+    Since we included musl's net/ethernet.h, which includes netinet/if_ether.h
+    that defines `struct ethhdr` (and the above constant), **after** we
+    include linux/if_ether.h, there was a compilation error because the
+    struct was defined multiple times.
+    
+    However, simply moving that include doesn't fix the problem because for
+    ARP-specific structs the Linux headers don't provide __UAPI_DEF* checks.
+    So instead of directly including the linux/ headers, we include those
+    provided by the C library.  For glibc these usually just include the
+    Linux headers, but for musl this allows them to define the struct
+    directly.  We also need to move if.h and add packet.h, which define
+    other structs (or include headers that do so) that we use.
+    
+    Fixes: 187c72d1afdc ("dhcp: Port the plugin to FreeBSD/macOS")
